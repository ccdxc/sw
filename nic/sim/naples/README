1. vagrant up

   This will bringup datacenters/kingdomws (as VMs) establish VM connectivity
   between them. Additionally, each of the VMs will have NAPLES container
   running already with all the components of Pensando NIC. This container
   represents the NIC in the VPN gateway of that datacenter. Use 'vagrant ssh
   node1/node2' to connect to VMs

5. Posting sample policies

   Sample postman configs are placed in the home directory of each VM. Run the
   following command in both the VMs to load the sample config

   $ newman run postman_collection.json -e postman_env.json

6. To do a fresh re-install of the naples container, re-provision the vargant VM
   using 'vagrant up --provision'

By default, port 9007 of the docker container is exposed to the host (i.e., VM
representing the datacenter) and hence REST APIs can be invoked using curl.

Examples:

In this example, we will use the pre-created "default" tenant.

Use default tenant:

curl localhost:9007/api/tenants/
[{"kind":"Tenant","meta":{"name":"default","tenant":"default","namespace":"default","creation-time":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","mod-time":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"spec":{},"status":{"TenantID":1}}]

To use non-default tenant, do:

curl -d'{"Kind":"Tenant","meta":{"Name":"tenant-1"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/tenants/

Create Namespaces:

curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"kg1","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/
curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"kg2","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/
curl -d'{"Kind":"Namespace","meta":{"Name":"public","Tenant":"default"}}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9007/api/namespaces/

Please refer to the packaged json files (located in the the home directory
inside each kingdom VM) for full config for kingdom1 and kingdom2.

NOTE:

1. To check NAPLES container health, please do "docker ps" and look at the
   STATUS column

2. If STATUS is reported as "unhealthy", please do:

   "docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}"  <container-id> | jq

   This should show the reason for bad health in case container is "unhealthy"

    For example:

    [root@d34a71a8b0a2 nic]# docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                    NAMES

    [root@d34a71a8b0a2 nic]# docker inspect --format "{{json .State.Health }}"  386c47101e22 | jq

3. There is no session aging in this release as the this is CAPRI s/w model, so
   in case flow keys are reused across sessions, data path state (e.g., NAT
   bindings etc.) will be reused in the data plane as well. If this is not
   intended, NAPLES container should be restarted.
