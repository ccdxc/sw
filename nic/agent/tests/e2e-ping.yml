# This is a sample test spec, which declares everything that is needed
# for an e2e. This can be applied at Venice, Agent or HAL level
# This file describes only the topology, objects and the bindings between them

# The object types, bindings should match with the entrypoint.
# Config generator will not auto-validate this.
# Config generator will ingest this file and generate required objects at the entrypoint respectively
